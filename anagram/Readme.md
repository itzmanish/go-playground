# Anagram problem

## Problem Statement

---

```
given 2 strings as input, string1 and string2. Find anagram of string2 within string1
if there's no possible anagram, print "no possible anagram"
if there's at least one possibility, print array of index of integer
The integers within the array are the index of string1 which is the starting position of the anagram of string2

example:
string1 := "abcdddd"
string2 := "abcd"
output: [0]

string1 := "aba"
string2 := "ab"
output: [0,1]
```
